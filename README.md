## GitHub Actions

This project can be configured to run automatically using GitHub Actions:

- Scheduled runs
- Self-hosted runners
- Caching for better performance

### Setting up GitHub Actions

#### 1. Register Slack Bot Token as GitHub Secret

To use Slack notifications in GitHub Actions workflows, you need to register your Slack Bot User OAuth Token:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your Slack Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
6. Click **Add secret**

#### 2. Workflow Configuration Example

The workflows use the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` to send notifications to Slack channels. Here's how to configure:

**For file change notifications** (`.github/workflows/noti-file-changed.yml`):
```yaml
- name: Send Slack notification
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.25.0
  with:
    channel-id: '#general' # Specify your target channel
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Your notification message"
      }
  env:
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

**For test results** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
```yaml
env:
  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}

# ... later in the workflow
- name: upload to slack
  run: npm run upload
```

#### 3. Getting a Slack Bot Token

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions**
4. Add the following Bot Token Scopes:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `files:write` - Upload files
5. Install the app to your workspace
6. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
7. Invite the bot to your desired channels (e.g., `/invite @YourBotName` in #general)
